# Learning 

In this assignment, I learned several key concepts:

Making Fetch Requests with the useEffect Hook: I explored how to use the useEffect hook along with its dependencies to make fetch requests in React. This allows us to perform side effects, such as data fetching, in functional components.

Using useState for UI Updates: I learned how to use the useState hook to manage state in a React component. This state management is crucial for updating the UI dynamically. When the state changes, the virtual DOM efficiently updates the actual DOM to reflect these changes.

Displaying a Loader During Data Fetching: I implemented a loader to provide visual feedback to users while data is being fetched. This enhances the user experience by indicating that a process is ongoing.
